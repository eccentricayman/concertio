Concert.io is a website where users can search for concerts or artists near a certain location. All the users need to do is enter a search term and/or a zip code and they will be taken to a results page with all the relevant events. If users click on an event, further details of the event are shown such as the time and location. There would also be a button linking the users to where they could purchase tickets. If they click on an artist, a page showing the artist's top tracks appear.
