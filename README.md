Concert.io is a website where users can search for concerts or artists near a certain location. All the users need to do is enter a search term and/or a zip code and they will be taken to a results page with all the relevant events. If users click on an event, further details of the event are shown such as the time and location. If they click on an artist, a page showing the artist's top tracks appear. There is also the option of creating an account on Concert.io. With an account, users can save certain events or artists that they are interested in.
