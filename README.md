# Usage
Concert.io is a website where users can search for concerts or artists near a certain location in the US. All the users need to do is enter an artist and/or a location and they will be taken to a results page with all the relevant events. If users click on an event, further details of the event are shown such as the time and location. There would also be a button linking the users to where they could purchase tickets. Under that, there is a list of all the artists performing at that event, and their most popular tracks.
