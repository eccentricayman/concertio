The major changes had to do with the APIs we ended up using:
    Both our original planned API had issues.
    So, they were both replaced with similiar functioning APIs.
    Spotify with MusixMatch and TicketMaster with Jambase.
    We also added bing image api and yahoo geoplanet api to replace lost functionality.

Another difference was the timeline:
    Because of the issues with apis in the beginning we werent able to keep to the schedule early on
    However because of the extra time alotted we managed to pace ourselves decently
